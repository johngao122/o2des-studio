# O2DES Studio

A modern web-based IDE for O2DES (Object-Oriented Discrete Event Simulation) framework, enabling visual modeling and simulation of discrete event systems. Currently in active development.

## 🚀 Features (In Progress)

-   📊 Visual modeling interface for O2DES components
-   🛠 Component-based architecture editor
-   🔌 Extensible plugin system
-   🎨 Modern, responsive UI built with Next.js

## 🏗 Project Status

This project is currently under active development. We're working on:

-   [ ] Core modeling interface
-   [ ] Simulation engine integration
-   [ ] Component library
-   [ ] Visual editor
-   [ ] Documentation system

## 🐛 Known Bugs

-   Node dragging causes website crash when moved excessively (under investigation)
-   Event graph edges are limited to straight lines due to rendering constraints (under investigation)
