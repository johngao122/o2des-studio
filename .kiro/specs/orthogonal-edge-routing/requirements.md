# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the edge routing system to provide orthogonal (non-diagonal) edge connections between nodes. The system will intelligently select the most efficient routing path and handle positions, providing users with clear visual feedback about routing decisions. This improvement will create cleaner, more professional-looking diagrams while maintaining usability through smart automation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want all edges to be orthogonal (horizontal and vertical segments only), so that my diagrams look more professional and structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an edge connection THEN the system SHALL render the edge using only horizontal and vertical line segments
2. WHEN a user drags to create an edge preview THEN the preview SHALL display orthogonal routing in real-time
3. WHEN an edge is finalized THEN the system SHALL maintain orthogonal routing without diagonal segments
4. IF an edge requires routing around obstacles THEN the system SHALL use only horizontal and vertical segments for the path

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want the system to choose between horizontal-first and vertical-first routing automatically, so that I get the most efficient edge paths without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an edge connection THEN the system SHALL calculate both horizontal-first and vertical-first routing options
2. WHEN multiple routing options exist THEN the system SHALL automatically select the shorter path length
3. IF path lengths are equal THEN the system SHALL use a consistent tie-breaking rule (e.g., prefer horizontal-first)
4. WHEN the optimal routing changes during edge creation THEN the preview SHALL update to reflect the new optimal path

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want the system to automatically select the most efficient handle positions on nodes, so that my edges take the shortest possible orthogonal paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an edge THEN the system SHALL evaluate all available handle combinations on source and target nodes
2. WHEN multiple handle combinations are available THEN the system SHALL select the combination that produces the shortest orthogonal path
3. WHEN dragging an edge preview THEN the system SHALL dynamically update handle selection as the target position changes
4. IF a more efficient handle becomes available during edge creation THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to use that handle

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want clear visual feedback about routing decisions, so that I understand why the system chose specific paths and handle positions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system selects a routing path THEN it SHALL provide visual indicators showing whether horizontal-first or vertical-first routing was chosen
2. WHEN handle positions are automatically selected THEN the system SHALL highlight or indicate which handles are being used
3. WHEN routing efficiency information is available THEN the system SHALL display path length or efficiency metrics through logs or UI elements
4. IF routing decisions change during edge creation THEN the visual feedback SHALL update in real-time to reflect the new decisions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a diagram creator, I want the orthogonal routing to work seamlessly with existing edge types and node configurations, so that I don't lose any current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using different edge types THEN the orthogonal routing SHALL work consistently across all edge variants
2. WHEN nodes have custom handle configurations THEN the routing system SHALL respect existing handle positions and constraints
3. WHEN loading existing diagrams THEN the system SHALL apply orthogonal routing to existing edges without breaking the diagram
4. IF edge properties or styling exist THEN the orthogonal routing SHALL preserve all existing edge properties and visual styling
